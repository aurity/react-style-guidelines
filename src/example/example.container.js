/* Rules for components:
 - Are concerned with how things WORK.
 - May contain both presentational and container components** inside but usually donâ€™t have any
  DOM markup of their own except for some wrapping divs, and never have any styles.
 - Provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components.
 - Call Flux actions and provide these as callbacks to the presentational components.
 - Are often stateful, as they tend to serve as data sources.
 - Are usually generated using higher order components such as connect() from React Redux,
  createContainer() from Relay, or Container.create() from Flux Utils, rather than written by hand.
